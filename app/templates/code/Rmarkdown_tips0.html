<p>I use <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com">Rmarkdown</a> almost every day and have been 
an intense user for the past 2 years.</p>

<p>I primarily use Rmarkdown to build and share next-generation sequencing reports for collaborators
or analysis code to my students or postdocs in the group. Having made many errors and written lots of
inefficient R code I would like to share some of my Rmarkdown tips that have helped me in the past</p> 


<h3>Tip1: Use R projects</h3>

<p>If you use Rstudio to write your Rmarkdown code then setting projects is super useful way organising your code. If you work on many different
projects then it can be a pain to set working directories and organise your data in a way that makes it easy to change
between projects easily.</p>

<p>To set up an R project its as easy as selecting <b>File</b> , <b>New Project...</b> then to switch between
projects you can use the top right projects tab and switch easily</p>

<h3>Tip2: Set global options for all code chunks</h3>

<p>Copy and pasting options for every chunk can be incredibly annoying and time wasting. Its better
to set the code options in the first chunk. This can be useful when writing sequencing analysis reports
for both non-computationally minded people, where code is distracting, and computational people, where
code is useful. For example, the <code>echo=TRUE/FALSE</code> can easily modify whether code will be displayed
or not when knitting. Addint this option for all of your code chunks can be time consuming. Thankfully, there
is a better way - you can specify <code>knitr::set_opts(echo=TRUE/FALSE)</code> and it will apply that option
to all chunks. For example:

<pre>
	<code>
		```{r setup, include=FALSE}
		knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE)
		```
	</code>
</pre>

<h3>Tip3: Name all of your code chunks</h3>

<p>You can name all code chunks, which can be quite time consuming when you have a huge Rmarkdown document,
particularly since each code chunk needs to have a unique name.</p>
<pre>
	<code>
		```{r name_of_code_chunk}
		some code here
		```
	</code>
</pre>

<p>However, there are some quite clear advantages to naming. For example, 1. It really helps with debugging,
as the code chunk can be easily identified by the name. 2. If
you have cacheing activated then there isn't a slowdown. 3. It makes your code documentation easier to understand
as you can give informative titles that can be used to remind you of what you did. </p>
