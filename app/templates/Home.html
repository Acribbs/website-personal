<p class="losinfo2">Traditionally, when we think of biological research, we usually think of traditional 'wet' lab experiments that generate 
informative data. Typically, when a biologist has a research question that requires significant quantitative or mathematical
approaches, they usually approach a bioinformatician or mathematician for answers to solve their questions. However, communication
between these two groups can usually break down due to reciprocal misunderstanding.</p>

<p class="losinfo2"> Having both a wet lab and computational background I aim to bridge the knowledge gap between
these two fields. My fellowship in computational biology provided me with a solid foundation in software development, statistics
and big data analytics. My computational biology work investigates the precise makeup of human genomes and the similarities
(and dissimilarities) important for translating preclinical research to clinical benefit. I am currently identifying 
gene networks and understanding gene expression and its regulation, while constructing computational models from genomic data 
so that function and dysfunction can be predicted, plus much more. </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica; font-color:black;"><span>A historical perspective</span></h2><br />

<div id="history-left">
<div class="losinfo4"> 
<p> I began my scientific career at the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology where I undertook a PhD investigating why
regulatory T cells (Treg) were defective in Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). I identified that DNA methylation at the CTLA-4 promoter
led to impaired Treg function that contributes to the inflammatory processes in RA.</p>
<p> Following my PhD I moved to Prof Sir Marc Feldmann (known for the discovery of
anti-TNF therapy in RA) and Prof Udo Oppermans laboratory at the Botnar research centre to
investigate epigenetic pathways that are important for T and NK cell activation. During this time I 
was using a number of whole genome wide techniques to analyse the contribution of histone marks to autoimmunity.</p>
<p> Despite developing extensive knowledge of experimental design and state-of-the art laboratory techniques, 
at the time I was unable to analyse the resulting data to a high standard, which motivated me to apply for my 
current MRC <b>fellowship in computational biology based at the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine (University of Oxford)</b>.</p>
<p> The CGAT training fellowship was a highly competitive 
program that had the remit of <b>“training the future leaders in computational genomics”</b>. During my time there, I
developed a number of computational skills that now allow me to write 
complex code, enabling the difficult analysis and interpretation of next-generation sequencing data.</p>
<p>Following my CGAT work, I have now been appointed group leader in systems biology at the Botnar Research Centre.</p>
<p> I am currently working on a number of really interesting projects in collaboration with a number of 
scientists across the University of Oxford, summaries of these can be found <a href="/Science">here.</a></p> 
<p> In addition to my on-going scientific work, I also have a passion for exploring the social, 
ethical and moral consequences
of my science. With this in mind I joined <a href="http://www.campion.ox.ac.uk">Campion hall</a>, 
as a Junior research fellow, here I explored the ethical consequences of genome technology. Please see a recent publication of this work <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29259526">here</a>.</p>
